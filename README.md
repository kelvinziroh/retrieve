# Retrieve
Automate Retrieval practice, spaced-repeition and interleaving to enhance one's learning.

## Acknowledgements
This project attempts to implement insights uncovered by *Brown et al. (2014)* from the book [Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013). It also draws some inspiration from [Al Sweigart's](https://alsweigart.com/) book, [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) which is an excellent resource for beginners who want to delve into the world of programming using the python programming language. 

## Background
According to *Brown et al. (2014)*, learning is misunderstood and people are going about learning in the wrong ways. To make sure we leverage the insights from the book, we need to be clear on some nomenclature as described in the book.

- **Learning**: acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities. Therefore, learning is deeper and more durable when it's effortful.

With this in mind let's get to the major ideas in the book that led to the implementation of said insights in the form of this project:
1. **Retrieval practice**: Trying to retrieve what you just read from memory by testing yourself. A good example is by using flashcards.
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Spacing out the retrieval practice over a long period of time to allow some forgetting to take place hence making the retrieval challenging consequently making the learning more durable.
3. **Interleaving**: It's better to mix up your practice between different topics with a single discipline or between disciplines that are related which enhances deeper understanding and connections between different topics.
